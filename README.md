Movie Recommender System
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. It utilizes the TMDB dataset from Kaggle, incorporating both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and formatting data for optimal model performance.
Algorithms: Implemented collaborative filtering (user-item interactions) and content-based filtering (movie features) to recommend movies based on user preferences.
Libraries Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
Model Evaluation: Used various metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to evaluate the performance of the recommendation models.
Deployment: The system is deployed on a website to showcase real-time recommendations.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset, available on Kaggle.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and get movie recommendations
